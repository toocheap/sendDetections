# Archived Tests

This directory contains test files that are no longer compatible with the current codebase structure but may still contain valuable test logic that could be adapted in the future.

## Files

- `test_async_api_additional.py` - Additional tests for AsyncApiClient that require significant mocking to work with the current structure.

## Reason for Archiving

Following the UX improvements that simplified the command structure, some tests became incompatible with the new API structure. Rather than deleting them completely, they are archived here for potential future reference or adaptation.
